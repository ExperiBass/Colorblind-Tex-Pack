# Colorblind-Tex-Pack

WIP texture pack for colorblind people, cause theres no updated and functional pack.


# TODO:
- [ ] Recolor Iron Ore (white maybe?)
- [ ] Recolor Diamond items (why are diamond ore and blocks blue but the tools arent???)
- [ ] Recolor various items:
- - [ ] Candles
- - [ ] Dyes
- [ ] Possibly give each ore and dye a different shape, if i can find someone whos good at pixel art...

# Installation
Get the repo, and either drop the folder into `minecraft/texturepacks` or run `package.sh` (linux only) and drop the zip file created into the texture packs folder. Then enable in-game. Minecraft will complain that the pack is out of date: ignore it, its perfectly updated.


Diamond and iron recolors done by `Rinku Inku#7330`
